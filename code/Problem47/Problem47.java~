PROBLEM: 
Distinct primes factors
Problem 47
The first two consecutive numbers to have two distinct prime factors are:

14 = 2 × 7
15 = 3 × 5

The first three consecutive numbers to have three distinct prime factors are:

644 = 2² × 7 × 23
645 = 3 × 5 × 43
646 = 2 × 17 × 19.

Find the first four consecutive integers to have four distinct prime factors. What is the first of these numbers?

/*
SOLUTION:
Solution is as follows: 
- use a basic sieve method to identify composite numbers
- as we go, we'll add each prime factor for each composite number to a list containing the other prime factors for that composite
- when we find a composite number with 4 (and no more) prime factors, we'll check to see if enough neighbouring numbers also have four identified prime factors
If they do, then we stop, otherwise we keep going.

The complexity of this solution is O(n^2) for n = size of integer set to search, when n is small
Complexity approaches O(n) as n approaches infinity, due to ratio of primes : composites approaching 0 as n approaches infinity. I think? Rough in-the-head visualisation to estimate this...
